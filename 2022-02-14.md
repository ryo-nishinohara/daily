# An additional look back 
This is an sdditional look back section.

You should fill in here at the end of each week and month.

# A look back on the week
First half of the week, I worked a lot and went workout almost everyday.
It was very good; however I was a bit nervous because I was packed inside the house for 3 days and there were no exciting and new experiences.
Hence I will try to sleep better and keep my mind calm.
Last half, I hanged out with my friends, went to karaoki and cerebrate my firiend's birthday.
Though, I couldn't keep my private and tinder separate.
I need to maintain the boundary between my private and tinder this week.
